Simple script to calculate your distance to the center of the nearest pipe.

A pipe is the direct connection between 2 planets, it is the shortest way. But it is also the most dangerous connection between both planets because pirates are often waiting in the pipe or warping between the planets to locate ships in the pipe and intercept them. 

So the safest way to travel to the outer planets is keep away from the pipe. Because space radar has a range of 4su and the pirate is maybe not in the center of the pipe and you don't him want to see you, you should take some distance. I often fly with a distance of 8+su to the pipe center.

A nice and good visualized explaination for a pipe can also be found here https://www.reddit.com/r/DualUniverse/comments/lg2zsn/a_basic_guide_to_the_pipe_made_in_ms_paint/
